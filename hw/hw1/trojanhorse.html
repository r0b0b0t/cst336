            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)">A Trojan Horse,</a> 
            or Trojan, is any malware which misleads user of its true intent. A key
            distinction of Trojans compared to other malware is that they spread via social engineering,
            such as duping a user into executing an e-mail attachment designed as something desirable
            to the targeted user.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p class="text-content">Payloads can vary amongst Trojans, but the most common Trojan is that
            which installs a backdoor to the targeted computer. This allows the controller unauthorized
            access to the affected computer. Trojans take advantage of security flaws of outdated software, such as IE
            or Chrome, and utilizze an anonymizer proxy to mask their internet usage from the targeted computer.
            With the rise of botnets and advertising that violates user privacy, Trojans have been on the rise.</p>     
            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
            Basic security measures apply. Do not open email attachments or run programs unless you trust the person
            from whom the software or file comes from.</p>
