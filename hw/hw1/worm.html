            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm">A computer worm</a> is 
            standalone malware that replicates itself to spread to other computers. It generally
            spreads through computer networks due to security failures on target computers.
            Worms almost always cause harm on networks, at the very least by consumming bandwidth.
            In contrast, viruses corrupt/modify files on the targeted computer.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p class="text-content">Worms are self-propagating that require no input from the targeted computer
            to initiate. Code attached to the worm that do something else besides spreading the worm
            are referred to as the "payload". The payload can cause various effects besides spreading the worm,
            such as installing a backdoor to the targeted computer. A backdoor can allow the computer to be
            controlled or used in some fashion from unwarranted external sources.</p>     
            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
            Always practice safe browsing practices. Operating systems should be kept up to date at all times. Unexpected, suspicous emails
            should not be opened, and any files or programs attached to such emails should not be open or run.</p>
