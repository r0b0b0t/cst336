        <h2>Spyware</h2>
        <main>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware">Spyware</a> is software that gathers information about
            a person or organization and sends the information to another oustide entity. Spyware may even
            take control of the computer the software is hosted on. Interestingly, spyware exists both 
            consentually and as malicious software.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p class="text-content">Spyware is mostly used for the purposes of tracking and storing Internet users' movements on the Web and serving up pop-up ads to Internet users. 
            Whenever spyware is used for malicious purposes, its presence is typically hidden from the user and can be difficult to detect. Some spyware, such as keyloggers, may be 
            installed by the owner of a shared, corporate, or public computer intentionally in order to monitor users. 
            Due to its less obvious intrusive nature, spyware usually manifests itself to the user as slight slowdowns,
            usually attributed to operating system updates or aging hardware.</p>     
            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
            Other than basic malware security practices, another good measure to prevent spyware is to
            not use Internet Explorere as a web browser. No browser is completely immmune, but IE has more vulnerabilities
            that can allow spyware from malicious websites compared to other web browsers..</p>
